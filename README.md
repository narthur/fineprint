Beeminder universal fineprint for [Narthur](https://www.beeminder.com/narthur)

A derail is not legit if any of the following conditions are true, unless the goal's fineprint explicitly nullifies the relevant conditions.

## 1. General

1. It happened on Saturday.
2. It happened because of automation gone awry.
3. I met goal requirements but botched data entry.
4. I met goal requirements but couldn't enter data because of lack of Internet access.
5. My wife vetos the derail (due to sickness or another reason).

## 2. Contracting Goals

1. The associated contract has been completed or otherwise terminated.
2. Progress can't be made due to the unavailability or unresponsiveness of the client.
3. The goal pertains to contracting generally and I had no active contracts at the time of derail.
